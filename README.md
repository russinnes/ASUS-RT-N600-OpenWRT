# ASUS-RT-N600-OpenWRT
OpenWRT Build for the ASUS N600 router

This binary firmware is for the Asus RT-N600 Router and contains OpenWrt SNAPSHOT r19805-574539ee2c / LuCI Master git-22.167.28356-8effea5

This must be initially flashed using the ASUS recovery tool, or as an upgrade from a previously flashed aftermarket firmware. 
Flashing from Padavan (If you are running my previous build) will not work. 

Everything is working except for the 5g WiFi LED. I'll keep plugging away at it. 

I plan to commit this board and the associated configs to the OpenWRT master when I get some more time. 

This puts a ton of power behind this router that is a few years old now.
